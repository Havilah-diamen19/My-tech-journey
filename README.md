# My-tech-journey
I got into the tech space September 29, 2024. where I started learning the basics which was html and css, for 30days consistently I challenge myself to build projects using just html and css then I foound it very challenging but at the end I realize that it was worth. Now it was time for me to go into the programming language where I picked Javascript to start with, Javsacript was strange to I actually thought it was as easy as html and css which was wrong on my part maybe because I didn't take my computer science courses seriously in my 100 and 200level back in the university. So for a while I gave up learning Javascript and got distracted in general, I stopped practising but I made effort to still study Javascript then with time it started making sense to me. In June 2025, I started becoming serious again and decided I wanted to go into backend engineering, then I enrolled into ALtschool Africa where I was told I need to have a strong foundation in Javascript to be an effecient backend engineer. I didn't mind I worked towards that and still do currently(14th of Jan, 2025) though I am currently backend system so glad I still tried to make effort in my backend engineering journey.
